# AloePlantDetection
A multi-label classification problem is solved using CNN. Model was trained on 1,000 images of 9 Aloe types (experienced over-fitting for abnormal class distribution). Created custom Cascade file to detect Aloe plant from frame/picture provided, by using Cascade-Trainer-GUI.  Tflite model was integrated as classifier with cascade file for live detection. OpenCV 4.5.4 is used as supporting library.
